# Project Requirements

## Functional Requirements

### SQL Parsing

1. Parse basic SQL statements:
   - SELECT statements with WHERE clause
   - INSERT statements
   - UPDATE statements with WHERE clause
   - DELETE statements with WHERE clause

### Query Operations

1. SELECT capabilities:

   - Select specific columns
   - Filter data using WHERE clause
   - Support basic comparison operators (=, >, <, >=, <=)

2. Data Modification:
   - Insert new records into tables
   - Update existing records
   - Delete records based on conditions

### Data Storage

1. In-memory data storage
2. Basic table structure support
3. Basic data types support (integers, strings)

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

1. Query execution time should be reasonable for small to medium datasets
2. Memory usage should be optimized

### Reliability

1. System should handle invalid SQL gracefully
2. Proper error messages for syntax errors
3. Data consistency during operations

### Maintainability

1. Well-documented code
2. Modular architecture
3. Unit test coverage > 80%

### Usability

1. Clear API for executing SQL statements
2. Detailed error messages
3. Easy integration with other Java applications

### Constraints

1. Java 7 compatibility (as per pom.xml)
2. Maven-based build system
3. Minimal external
